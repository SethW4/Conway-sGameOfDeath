# ConwaysGameOfDeath
A game based on Conway's Game of Life. 
It's a grid-based, time-based, terminal-based, semi-rhythm-game.
It has two modes that it alternates between: 
  * One adheres to the rules of Conway's Game of Life
  * And the other is my take on a terminal rhythm game 

Written in C of course. We all know C is designed for this sort of thing. 
Just try not to crash it, because the ncurses window will take your terminal down with it. 
If your terminal does get softlocked just restart it and it should be fine afterwards. 

It only works on Linux, even if you manage to get the bash file to run on a different OS. 

Download all the code into some directory and run the bash file to run it.
